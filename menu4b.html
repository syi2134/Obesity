		<div class="baby2">Here is one example how exercising can benefit your everyday life. Biking is very good for your muscles especially your calves. It is also an easier way to get to work, school, or even going to your friends house. You won't have to deal with traffic and you get to workout at the same time. It's like killing two birds with one stone. You do all different types of exercises in your everyday life, but if you are overweight you just have to work a little harder than everyone else. In the end all the hard work will pay off trust me.     </div>
		<div class="baby2">There are various amount of ways you can exercise to loose weight. For example you can take dance classes, do karate, go to the gym, lift weights,play sports, use television exercise shows or youtube tutorials and much more. One of the type of exercises is shown above. A cardio workout is mostly for your heart, but it helps burn belly fat as well.When you think about exercising you should not just think about the gym, and machines, and weights. There are alot of other things you can do to exercise. You just have to find something that you love doing. Even if you walk everyday to work and use the stair instead of the elevator that will help. Just make sure to keep your workouts consistent or else you will feel the pain all over again.    </div>
		<div class="baby2">If you want to shed pounds, you need to incorporate the following principles into your training plan, your workouts and how you perform the exercises:Step out of your comfort zone, and don’t give your body the chance to get used to a routine. Mix up the intensity, duration and volume of your workouts by changing the distance, number of sets and repetitions. Vary the frequency of exercises, and work intervals into your cardio sessions. Shoot for more efficiency in your cardiovascular training by including bodyweight training. Runtastic Results is a great way to combine your strength and cardio training.Incorporate a specific strength training session with free weights into your weekly training plan. To keep it simple: The more muscle you have in terms of your total body mass, the more calories you burn per workout.he three pillars of training, sleep and nutrition form the basis for reaching your ideal weight in a steady and lasting way. You have to consider and optimize each and every aspect.One very important rule that everyone should follow regardless of fitness level is “Never skip a rest day!” Make sure to take a break from all fitness activities at least once a week.</div>
